# Hello Purr Enhanced

This project recreates a fun, interactive app using **MIT App Inventor**. The app allows users to:
- Play a meowing sound and vibrate the device when the button is clicked.
- Play a secondary sound when the device is shaken.

## Features
- **Pet the Cat Button**: Triggers a meowing sound and vibration when clicked.
- **Shake Interaction**: Plays a fun sound when the device is shaken using the accelerometer sensor.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Perfect for learning how to use images, buttons, sounds, and sensors in app development.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Setting Up the Project
1. Open [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/).
2. Create a new project. Name it `HelloPurrEnhanced`.

---

### 2. Designing the User Interface
1. **Add Components**:
   - **Image**:
     - Drag an **Image** component onto the screen.
     - Upload a cat image (e.g., a cute kitten).
   - **Button**:
     - Drag a **Button** component below the cat image.
     - Set its **Text** property to `Pet the cute Cat`.
     - Customize the button's background and text colors.
   - **Accelerometer Sensor**:
     - Drag an **AccelerometerSensor** component to the screen (non-visible).

2. **Customizing Layout**:
   - Center-align all components.
   - Adjust the size of the image and button for better visuals.

### 3. Adding Sounds
1. **Add Sound Components**:
   - Drag two **Sound** components to the screen (non-visible).
   - Upload sound files:
     - `Sound1`: Cat meow sound.
     - `Sound2`: Fun effect for shaking.

---

### 4. Programming with Blocks
Switch to the **Blocks Editor** and add the following logic:

1. **Button Click Event**:
   - Add a `when Button1.Click` block.
   - Inside it, add:
     - `call Sound1.Play`: Plays the cat meow.
     - `call Sound1.Vibrate`: Vibrates the device for 500 milliseconds.

2. **Shake Event**:
   - Add a `when AccelerometerSensor1.Shaking` block.
   - Inside it, add:
     - `call Sound2.Play`: Plays a fun sound when the device is shaken.

## Example Code Blocks
```plaintext
When Button1.Click
    Call Sound1.Play
    Call Sound1.Vibrate (500 ms)

When AccelerometerSensor1.Shaking
    Call Sound2.Play
